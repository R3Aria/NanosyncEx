                <h1 id="center-text">Anime</h1>
                <p>I'm an avid anime enjoyer, a <em>weeb</em> if you will, so much so that I, at the time of coding this, have waited a week for 1 episode of an anime to release once every saturday at 12:30pm for the past 11 or so weeks. The anime in question is Solo Leveling Season 2. I have done the same for many other animes, one of which actually got an episode right as I reloaded the page I was watching the previous episodes on which was amazing timing.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2 id="center-text">Genre</h2>
                <p>The main genre of anime that I prefer to watch is Slice of Life and Romance as well as ocasionally Isaki. I'll have a list of animes that I have watched below this. For the most part, the way I choose what anime to watch is by seeing clips of that anime and deciding on if it's something that I might like to watch. I also don't like to watch another anime until I've completed the one I'm currently watching, unless it's an anime that is currently being released. Even if an anime is boring to me, I still feel compelled to complete it, one anime that I can think of that was like this was "A certain magical index", the entire anime wasn't boring but, if I remember correctly, it was season 3 which was boring but it had a season 4 so I wanted to complete season 3 before moving to season 4.</p>

                <p>As you may know by now, my name is Antonio Tyler Nathanael Estrada. I have a few hobbies which include <strong>gaming, watching anime, drawing and only reacently I've starting reading.</strong></p>
                <hr>
                <p>I have a few pets, 4 cats, a dog and a parrot. I have one major phobia, arachnophobia, absolutly terrified of spiders, anything else I can somewhat handle, snakes, bugs whatever, but <strong>NOT</strong> spiders.</p>

                <h2 id="center-text">Story time</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fun little story, it had a night I woke up to a snake just chilling on my fan, it was around midnight but that wasn't really a problem.</li>
                    <li>There was also the time a spider almost droped on me from the roof (I didn't even know it was there), and it fell centimeters from my feet. I was just chilling on my bed watching youtube and it decided, y'know what, I want to give someone a heart attack today, Imma just drop on this guys bed just cause.</li>
                    <li>The cats I have also just drag snakes in from outside and play with it. Thats probably how the snake got on my fan from story 1</li>
